# Purple Team
Writing this as my personal notes for knowledge resources I will approach in a roadmap. A number of these resources I had already purchased and/or will be studying to sharpen my skills, which I'd also recommend for others. A significant portion of the gained knowledge will be used to develop tools or rise in blog spotlights to share the lessons learned from these experiences.
